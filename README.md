## My process

- I always start designing by following 4 steps:

   - First HTML Structure (start with header section).
   - Added CSS Designing. 
   - Added Media queries.
   - In Last JavaScript.

- After completing header section , move onto next section and , will follow same those above 4 steps.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript.

### What I learned

There were many things that I got in touch for the first time. Like:

- Dropdown Language button.
- Added Background videos to eloctronic images was bit difficult , but somehow, managed to do it. 
- FAQ part : I was unable to make interactions completely similar to design . I did a lot of search and couldn't find a proper way on how to do it. So, did in my way.
- Floating labels. 
- Form validation . It was a fun part until you know how to do it. Otherwise, it's really frustrating. I messed up many times while designing error messages but it was a good to go as I learned a lot.
